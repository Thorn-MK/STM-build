# Log-1 Project start 

This is the start of my STM (Scanning Tunneling Microscope) build log. I’m 15 years old, and my goal is to design and build a functioning STM while learning a range of skills, including PCB design and 3D modeling in Blender.

I was heavily inspired by [MechPanda’s DIY STM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7N3OqTEq08g&list=PLn8BCVcdKVV08F5PhR8LA6lP4scTdolT2&index=85) and [Dan Berard’s STM](https://dberard.com/home-built-stm/), which helped me understand how DIY STMs can be built.

Right now, I’m focusing on selecting and ordering hardware. Once the parts arrive, I’ll start modeling the 3D components for the build.

This is a long-term learning project, expected to take around six months. I’ll document design decisions, mistakes, and progress here on GitHub and on other linked platforms.

I’m also hoping to connect with experienced makers and mentors. I want to learn from others and develop the skills needed to tackle ambitious projects and pursue a future in advanced engineering or research.
